# python-ssh
Python program to interact with a remote host over ssh.

This program will use paramiko for ssh.

The intent of this program is to develop a generic tool that can be applied to multiple solutions with little modification to suit the purpose.

While I am working things out some of the code here is a derivative of some demos from paramiko.
